Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Related\",\n          \"When hearing of an establishment called the Black and Blue Steakhouse, one could reasonably surmise that some, or at the very least one, extremely tough person could be found somewhere in there. Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) \\nWith apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week–FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \\nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \\nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \\nSo let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \\nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \\nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. \\nGranted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.’ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton’s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November’s election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn’t president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.   \n",

The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government’s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out – specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want – a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth – that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere.

However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors – those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview – have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council – yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We’re looking for truth. But we’re particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview – their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you’re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory – the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers – the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class – presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare’s determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will – no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.   \n",

Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \\nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \\nThe US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \\nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \\nRais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \\nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” \\nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \\nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \\nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \\nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \\nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \\nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \\nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she’d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n“When the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment – without a warrant – and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,” the article stated. \\n“One of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery – never published, never presented to anyone,” the article stated. “The narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.   \n",

                                          In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason. [In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie discusses the looming threat of North Korea, and explains how President Donald Trump could win the support of the Hollywood left if the U. S. needs to strike first.  “If he decides to bomb them, the whole country will be behind him, because everybody will realize he had no choice and that was the only thing to do,” Jackie says. “Except the Hollywood left. They’ll get nauseous. ” “[Trump] could win the left over, they’ll fall in love with him in a minute. If he bombed them for a better reason,” Jackie explains. “Like if they have no transgender toilets. ” Jackie also says it’s no surprise that Hollywood celebrities didn’t support Trump’s strike on a Syrian airfield this month. “They were infuriated,” he says. “Because it might only save lives. That doesn’t mean anything to them. If it only saved the environment, or climate change! They’d be the happiest people in the world. ” Still, Jackie says he’s got nothing against Hollywood celebs. They’ve got a tough life in this country. Watch Jackie’s latest clip above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum   \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           PARIS  —   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday’s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoît Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would “make France’s heart beat,” bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls’s 41 percent. “Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,” Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. “Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,” he said. Mr. Hamon’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, François Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France’s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande’s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon’s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande’s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. “We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,” Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande’s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France’s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). “We have someone that trusts us,” Mr. Kekenbosch said, “who says: ‘I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald’s on provisional contracts for 4 years. ” Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.   \n",
              "7  A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.   \n",

[Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocate[ing] for the president’s policies. ” In a recent Facebook post titled, “Take a deep breath. Then take action,” OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. “Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,” the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. ” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. ” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions  —   while keeping “a firm hold on the mic”  —   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers. ” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says.   …    “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. ” Sperry reported OFA “plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. ” Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that “conservatives” are “spreading unfounded rumors” that the group is “being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. ” Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet’s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed “Indivisible,” the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump’s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have “signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. ” The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group’s website states: “What’s more, you all are putting the guide into action —  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You’re resisting —  and it’s working. ” Politico reported on “unfounded” rumors being spread about Soros’s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): “It doesn’t matter who we take money from  —   we’re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don’t take money from Soros,” said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. “That’s one of the attacks and that’s fine. ” While “Indivisible” has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico’s claim about “unfounded rumors” that Indivisibles’ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump’s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla’s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible’s ties to the organizers of last month’s   Women’s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women’s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women’s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

Islamic State twist, has been criticised by Leftists and Muslims who claim the sketch is offensive. [The BBC released the trailer earlier this week and were immediately slammed by those on the left and Muslims who thought that making fun of the brides of members of the terror group was out of the bounds of conventional humour. The sketch is part of a new programme called “Revolting” written by Jolyon Rubinstein and Heydon Prowse which, according to the BBC, is “satirising the state of the nation. ”  LOLOLOL pic. twitter.   —   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) January 4, 2017,  The BBC2 Facebook page was inundated with criticism. One user wrote, “I’m mortified that the BBC had produced such a programme. This is simply bad taste. The fact it is a comedy makes it even more worrying that humour should be associated with the actions of ISIS. Is this really what TV licenses are funding! ?” Others took a different point of view including a Muslim saying, “As a Muslim I find this HILARIOUS! Brilliant! The satire is on point highlighting the pathetic ideals of a pathetic group like ISIS. ” Not all Muslims agreed with the sentiment and users on Twitter expressed just as much outrage for the sketch. One man, a Bangladeshi, said “The BBC really made a satirical show called ‘The Real Housewives of ISIS’ while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily. ”   The BBC really made a satirical show called ”The Real Housewives of ISIS” while the real housewives of ISIS are being raped and abused daily,  —   Meraj.

Thanks @BBC for adding to the negative stereotype,  —   aѕн (@AshKaneSkittles) January 4, 2017,  Leftists also articulated how offended they were that the public broadcaster would dare create such a sketch mocking Islamic State. Some questioned whether the use of taxpayer money via the TV license fee should go toward the funding of the programme. As if people’s TV license in this country is going towards funding the production of a programme called ”the real housewives of ISIS”. Wow,  —   Cameron Edgar (@CammyyyEdgar) January 4, 2017,    The video itself has already been viewed millions of times on Facebook and other social media platforms.  The clip shows several women in hijabs talking to each other in a    house taking selfies and showing off their suicide belts to each other. One woman even mentions that she hadn’t come from Birmingham “to do this” as she scrubbed the floor of the home. Women joining Islamic State and travelling to Syria to become brides has become a real problem in European countries as the terror group promises young girls a more glamorous lifestyle. In 2014, eight schoolgirls from Bethnal Green travelled to Syria to become brides of Islamic State fighters, all of them under the age of 18.   \n",

But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \\nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \\nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \\nSo let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \\nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \\nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. \\nGranted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

              "      <td>Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed “no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be” (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). “I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us —  the 400 of us,” Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom —  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for “empathy” for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented “Black Power demagogues” and “elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance” within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. “Trust,” Rodham ironically observed in 1969, “this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said ‘Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.’ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?” The “trust bust” certainly busted Clinton’s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people —  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November’s election —  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a “lie,” a “con,” “alternative facts,” and “a   assault on truth and reason. ” She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. “As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” she offered. “That is not hyperbole. ” Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that “for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. ” Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn’t president. The woman famously dubbed a “congenital liar” by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in —  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for “regime change” in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government’s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out – specifically, how to tell when they are getting “true” intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need “ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. ” To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA “partnership” is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a “ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board” to coordinate programs in “social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .” \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the “social and behavioral sciences” cannot give the spy agencies what they want – a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth – that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them “snake oil,” they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors – those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview – have different criterion for what is “true” than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council – yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, “ We’re looking for truth. But we’re particularly looking for truth that works. ” Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, “truth” must match up, fit with, their worldview – their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not “work.” So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by “group think,” ideological blinkers, and a “we know better” attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you’re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory – the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers – the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class – presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare’s determination that “what is past, is prelude.” Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will – no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.</td>\n",

Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \\nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \\nThe US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \\nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \\nRais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \\nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” \\nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \\nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \\nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \\nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \\nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \\nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \\nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

              "      <td>PARIS  —   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sunday’s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoît Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would “make France’s heart beat,” bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Valls’s 41 percent. “Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,” Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. “Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,” he said. Mr. Hamon’s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamon’s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, François Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. France’s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollande’s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamon’s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollande’s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. “We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,” Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollande’s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving France’s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). “We have someone that trusts us,” Mr. Kekenbosch said, “who says: ‘I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonald’s on provisional contracts for 4 years. ” Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest President Donald Trump’s agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocate[ing] for the president’s policies. ” In a recent Facebook post titled, “Take a deep breath. Then take action,” OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. “Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,” the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. ” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. ” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions  —   while keeping “a firm hold on the mic”  —   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers. ” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says.   …    “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. ” Sperry reported OFA “plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. ” Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  —   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  —   and a deputy campaign manager.   …    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible’s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine’s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that “conservatives” are “spreading unfounded rumors” that the group is “being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. ” Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet’s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed “Indivisible,” the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump’s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have “signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. ” The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group’s website states: “What’s more, you all are putting the guide into action —  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You’re resisting —  and it’s working. ” Politico reported on “unfounded” rumors being spread about Soros’s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): “It doesn’t matter who we take money from  —   we’re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don’t take money from Soros,” said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. “That’s one of the attacks and that’s fine. ” While “Indivisible” has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico’s claim about “unfounded rumors” that Indivisibles’ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump’s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla’s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible’s ties to the organizers of last month’s   Women’s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women’s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women’s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

No injuries have been declared or deaths at the time of this writing.\\nThe flight was initially delayted because of unknown problems at LaGuardia, giving Pence time to toss the football around while stranded on the tarmac in Iowa, and tweet this photo reported Fox6. \\n(THIS IS A BREAKING, DEVELOPING STORY AND UPDATES WILL BE ADDED AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.)\\nThe post BREAKING: Plane Carrying U.S. VP Candidate MIKE PENCE Slides Off The Runway appeared first on We Are Change .\\n\",\n          \"The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here   15th, 2016 \\nA record-setting drought has gripped the southern United States, but most people have no idea that this drought is the fulfillment of a prophecy that was given four years ago. Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled \\u201c The Perfect Storm \\u201d in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to \\u201cThe Perfect Storm\\u201d that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. \\nSpecifically, I am referring to this headline: \\u201cRecord High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South\\u201d . \\nIn an article entitled \\u201c July\\u2019s Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South \\u201c, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. \\nIn addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America\\u2026 \\n\\u201cDrought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise\\u201d \\n\\u201cDemand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets\\u201d \\n\\u201cFood Prices Lead Nation\\u2019s Escalating Inflation Woes\\u201d \\n\\u201cSysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget\\u201d \\nAnd of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. \\nThe following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 \\u2026 \\nI was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, \\u201cThere will be a famine of food in your nation!\\u201d Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! \\nDr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America \\u2026 \\n\\u201cI\\u2019m instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.\\u201d \\nWith those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment\\u2026 \\nThe drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled \\u201c Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast \\u201c\\u2026 \\nThe atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . \\nThe upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Ni\\u00f1a winters. \\nTo say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven\\u2019t seen any measurable rain in about 50 days \\u2026 \\nNo measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham\\u2019s Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record \\u2013 52 straight days \\u2013 from fall 1924. \\nNine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham\\u2019s rainfall so far this fall. \\nAnniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. \\nAnd unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon \\u2026 \\nThere are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. \\nThe region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. \\n\\u201cThings will only get worse before they get better,\\u201d Margusity explained. \\nWhenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. \\nRight now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. \\nAs you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as \\u201c California wildfires in North Carolina \\u201c, and he is not exaggerating one bit. \\nIf what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. \\nAnd as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. \\nMost of us couldn\\u2019t imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. \\nAs I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago \\u2026 \\nI saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don\\u2019t have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. \\nThese days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. \\nBut the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.\",\n          \"Two migrants have been given sentences of three and     years for beating a young man almost to death before violently raping his female friend. The government will try to deport only one of them, temporarily. [The Freie Zeiten reports that three teenage girls and one male friend met for a party at an apartment in Kista, near Stockholm, citing Solna District Court documents.  One of the girls invited a    migrant from Liberia, Richelieu Jarara, with whom she was acquainted. This man brought another African migrant, a Kenyan named Fayed Mwangi, with him. Before long, the migrants began sexually harassing the girls. Matters quickly escalated from there, with the pair conferring briefly before spraying their friend in the face with pepper spray. The Freie Zeiten describes how they then beat and kicked the man with \\u201cbrutal force\\u201d  leaving him with \\u201cmultiple cerebral haemorrhages, severe swelling and bruises all over his body, as well as bone fractures and open wounds\\u201d. The three girls, as well as the attackers, thought the young man had been beaten to death, with Jarara actually uploading a video to Snapchat in which he made light of having \\u201ckilled a guy\\u201d. He was, in fact, still alive, but unconscious and permanently brain damaged. Jarara\\u2019s younger companion,    Mwangi, is said to have \\u201cstrangled\\u201d one of the girls when she tried to intervene, slamming her into a wall and \\u201churling\\u201d her to the floor. The Kenyan then grabbed another of the girls by the hair, dragged her into the bedroom and raped her. She was also strangled, with the Kenyan threatening to strike her if she screamed. The ordeal was finally brought to an end when a neighbour burst into the apartment, allowing the girls to flee. According to the Fria Tider, the court sentenced Mwangi to just     years for his crimes, despite his having raped another woman in May 2016. The government will attempt to deport him afterwards  \\u2014   although he will be allowed to return to the country after ten years, and judges have prevented other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, from following through on deporting criminal migrants after their sentences in the past. Jarara, who has a string of previous convictions for crimes including theft, serious bodily injury, and resisting arrest, was given a slightly longer sentence  \\u2014   three years  \\u2014   but he will not be deported.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

lucus on october      subscribe jason chaffetz on the stump in american fork  utah   image courtesy michael jolley  available under a creative commons by license   with apologies to keith olbermann  there is no doubt who the worst person in the world is this week fbi director james comey  but according to a house democratic aide  it looks like we also know who the second worst person is as well  it turns out that when comey sent his now infamous letter announcing that the fbi was looking into emails that may be related to hillary clinton s email server  the ranking democrats on the relevant committees didn t hear about it from comey  they found out via a tweet from one of the republican committee chairmen   as we now know  comey notified the republican chairmen and democratic ranking members of the house intelligence  judiciary  and oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information  not long after this letter went out  oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet  fbi dir just informed me   the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation   case reopened    jason chaffetz   jasoninthehouse  october       of course  we now know that this was not the case   comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of  an unrelated case  which we now know to be anthony weiner s sexting with a teenager  but apparently such little things as facts didn t matter to chaffetz  the utah republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if hillary wins at least two years  worth  and possibly an entire term s worth of them  apparently chaffetz thought the fbi was already doing his work for him resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud   but according to a senior house democratic aide  misreading that letter may have been the least of chaffetz  sins  that aide told shareblue that his boss and other democrats didn t even know about comey s letter at the time and only found out when they checked twitter   democratic ranking members on the relevant committees didn t receive comey s letter until after the republican chairmen  in fact  the democratic ranking members didn  receive it until after the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee  jason chaffetz  tweeted it out and made it public    so let s see if we ve got this right  the fbi director tells chaffetz and other gop committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation  and neither chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their democratic counterparts know about it  instead  according to this aide  he made them find out about it on twitter   there has already been talk on daily kos that comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to chaffetz and other republicans  giving them time to turn on the spin machine  that may make for good theater  but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case  after all  there is nothing so far that suggests that comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone deaf   what it does suggest  however  is that chaffetz is acting in a way that makes dan burton and darrell issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship  he didn t even have the decency to notify ranking member elijah cummings about something this explosive  if that doesn t trample on basic standards of fairness  i don t know what does   granted  it s not likely that chaffetz will have to answer for this  he sits in a ridiculously republican district anchored in provo and orem  it has a cook partisan voting index of r    and gave mitt romney a punishing   percent of the vote in    moreover  the republican house leadership has given its full support to chaffetz  planned fishing expedition  but that doesn t mean we can t turn the hot lights on him  after all  he is a textbook example of what the house has become under republican control  and he is also the second worst person in the world  about darrell lucus  darrell is a   something graduate of the university of north carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school  an attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious right s worst nightmare  a charismatic christian who is an unapologetic liberal  his desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only increased when he survived an abusive three year marriage  you may know him on daily kos as christian dem in nc   follow him on twitter  darrelllucus or connect with

days the way miss havisham forever wore that wedding dress   speaking of great expectations  hillary rodham overflowed with them   years ago when she first addressed a wellesley graduating class  the president of the college informed those gathered in   that the students needed  no debate so far as i could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be   kind of the like the democratic primaries in   minus the   terms unknown then even at a seven sisters school    i am very glad that miss adams made it clear that what i am speaking for today is all of us    the   of us   miss rodham told her classmates  after appointing herself edger bergen to the charlie mccarthys and mortimer snerds in attendance  the    bespectacled in granny glasses  awarding her matronly wisdom    or at least john lennon wisdom  took issue with the previous speaker  despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the u  s  senate since reconstruction  edward brooke came in for criticism for calling for  empathy  for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics  though clinton in her senior thesis on saul alinsky lamented  black power demagogues  and  elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance  within the new left  similar words coming out of a republican necessitated a brief rebuttal   trust   rodham ironically observed in     this is one word that when i asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them  everyone came up to me and said  talk about trust  talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others  talk about the trust bust   what can you say about it  what can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted   the  trust bust  certainly busted clinton s   plans  she certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her  after whitewater  travelgate  the vast   conspiracy  benghazi  and the missing emails  clinton found herself the distrusted voice on friday  there was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons  and distrust from the american people    trump edged her   percent to   percent on the question immediately prior to november s election    stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons  clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a  lie   a  con    alternative facts   and  a   assault on truth and reason    she failed to explain why the american people chose his lies over her truth   as the history majors among you here today know all too well  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them  it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society   she offered   that is not hyperbole    like so many people to emerge from the    hillary clinton embarked upon a long  strange trip  from high school goldwater girl and wellesley college republican president to democratic politician  clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree  more significantly  she went from idealist to cynic  as a comparison of her two wellesley commencement addresses show  way back when  she lamented that  for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible  and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible    now  as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the white house  she wonders how her current station is even possible   why aren t i   points ahead   she asked in september  in may she asks why she isn t president  the woman famously dubbed a  congenital liar  by bill safire concludes that lies did her in    theirs  mind you  not hers  getting stood up on election day  like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day  inspires dangerous delusions    \n",

october       the tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results  with the latter often overwhelming the former  as in the iraq war  writes lawrence davidson   by lawrence davidson  for those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices  some insight might be drawn from the following analysis  the action here plays out in the united states  but the lessons are probably universal   back in the early spring of    george w  bush initiated the invasion of iraq  one of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country s dictator  saddam hussein  was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction  the real reason went beyond that charge and included a long range plan for  regime change  in the middle east  president george w  bush and vice president dick cheney receive an oval office briefing from cia director george tenet  also present is chief of staff andy card  on right    white house photo   for our purposes  we will concentrate on the belief that iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power  why did president bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily   the short answer is bush wanted  indeed needed  to believe it as a rationale for invading iraq  at first he had tried to connect saddam hussein to the     attacks on the u s  though he never gave up on that stratagem  the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an american people  already fixated on afghanistan  to support a war against baghdad   but the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful  not because there was any hard evidence for the charge  but because supposedly reliable witnesses  in the persons of exiled anti saddam iraqis  many on the u s  government s payroll    kept telling bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true   what we had was a u s  leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous iraq  and informants who  in order to precipitate the overthrow of saddam  were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons  the strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear iraq lowered the threshold for proof   likewise  the repeated assertions by assumed dependable iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide u s  campaign generating both fear and war fever   so the u s  and its allies insisted that the united nations send in weapons inspectors to scour iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program  as well as chemical and biological weapons   that the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the bush administration and soon forced its hand   on march       bush launched the invasion of iraq with the expectation was that  once in occupation of the country  u s  inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes  or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons   they did not  their iraqi informants had systematically lied to them   social and behavioral sciences to the rescue   the various u s  intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair  and today    years later  their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out   specifically  how to tell when they are getting  true  intelligence and when they are being lied to  or  as one intelligence worker has put it  we need   help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen    to that end the cia et al  are in the market for academic assistance  ahmed chalabi  head of the iraqi national congress  a key supplier of iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden wmd   a  partnership  is being forged between the office of the director of national intelligence  odni   which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent u s  intelligence agencies  and the national academies of sciences  engineering and medicine   the result of this collaboration will be a   permanent intelligence community studies board  to coordinate programs in  social and behavioral science research  that  might strengthen national security     despite this effort  it is almost certain that the  social and behavioral sciences  cannot give the spy agencies what they want   a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations  but even if they could  it might well make no difference  because the real problem is not to be found with the liars  it is to be found with the believers   the believers  it is simply not true  as the odni leaders seem to assert  that u s  intelligence agency personnel cannot tell  more often than not  that they are being lied to  this is the case because there are thousands of middle echelon intelligence workers  desk officers  and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth   that is  they know pretty well what is going on in places like afghanistan  iraq  syria  libya  israel  palestine and elsewhere  director of national intelligence james clapper  right  talks with president barack obama in the oval office  with john brennan and other national security aides present   photo credit  office of director of national intelligence   therefore  if someone feeds them  snake oil   they usually know it  however  having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors   those who got their appointments by accepting a pre structured worldview   have different criterion for what is  true  than do the analysts   listen to charles gaukel  of the national intelligence council   yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the   intelligence agencies  referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies  gaukel has declared    we re looking for truth  but we re particularly looking for truth that works    now what might that mean   i can certainly tell you what it means historically  it means that for the power brokers   truth  must match up  fit with  their worldview   their political and ideological precepts  if it does not fit  it does not  work   so the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by  group think   ideological blinkers  and a  we know better  attitude   on the other hand  as long as what you re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe  you can peddle them anything  imaginary iraqi nukes  israel as a western style democracy  saudi arabia as an indispensable ally  libya as a liberated country  bashar al assad as the real roadblock to peace in syria  the strategic defense initiative  sdi  aka star wars  a world that is getting colder and not warmer  american exceptionalism in all its glory   the list is almost endless   what does this sad tale tell us  if you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence  forget about the liars  what you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow mindedness of the believers   the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class   presumptions that underpin their self confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes   it has happened this way so often  and in so many places  that it is the source of shakespeare s determination that  what is past  is prelude   our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will   no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing  yet the middle echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power  hope springs eternal    \n",

engaged in active combat operations    photo of hellfire missiles being loaded onto a us military reaper drone in afghanistan by staff sgt  brian ferguson u s  air force   the bureau has been able to identify   civilians killed in a single us drone strike in afghanistan last month   the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the medecins sans frontieres hospital  msf  last october   the us claimed it had conducted a  counter terrorism  strike against islamic state  is  fighters when it hit nangarhar province with missiles on september    but the next day the united nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed   civilians and injured   others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder s return from a pilgrimage to mecca   the bureau spoke to a man named haji rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted  he said   people were killed and   others injured  and provided their names  listed below   the bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died   rais  son  a headmaster at a local school  was among them  another man  abdul hakim  lost three of his sons in the attack   rais said he had no involvement with is and denied us claims that is members had visited his house before the strike  he said   i did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house    the deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single american strike in afghanistan since the attack on the msf hospital in kunduz last october  which killed at least   people   the nangarhar strike was not the only us attack to kill civilians in september  the bureau s data indicates that as many as   civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four american strikes in afghanistan and somalia that month   on september   a pair of strikes killed eight afghan policemen in tarinkot  the capital of urozgan provice  us jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint  killing one officer  before returning to target first responders  the use of this tactic   known as a  double tap  strike   is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers   the us told the bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to afghan forces  the email did not directly address the allegations of afghan policemen being killed   at the end of the month in somalia  citizens burnt us flags on the streets of the north central city of galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed   somali soldiers and civilians  the strike occurred on the same day as the one in nangarhar   in both the somali and afghan incidents  the us at first denied that any non combatants had been killed  it is now investigating both the strikes in nangarhar and galcayo   the rate at which civilians are being killed by american airstrikes in afghanistan is now higher than it was in   when the us was

represent the socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring  the candidate  beno t hamon     who ran on the slogan that he would  make france s heart beat   bested manuel valls  the former prime minister  whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background  mr  hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin  with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated   percent of the vote to mr  valls s   percent   tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future   mr  hamon said  addressing his supporters   our country needs the left  but a modern  innovative left   he said  mr  hamon s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of president fran ois hollande  who in december announced that he would not seek    however  mr  hamon s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election  the first round of the general election is set for april   and the runoff for may    the socialist party is deeply divided  and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting  about two million people voted in the second round of the primary on sunday  in contrast with about      million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left  in    however  much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week  because the leading candidate  fran ois fillon  who represents the main   party  the republicans  was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide  while nepotism is legal in the french political system  it is not clear that she actually did any work  prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case  france s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting  but only the top two   go on to a second round  mr  hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left  with candidates who include   m lenchon on the far left  and emmanuel macron  an independent who served as economy minister in mr  hollande s government and who embraces more   policies  unless he decides to withdraw  mr  fillon  the mainstream right candidate  will also run  as will the extreme right candidate marine le pen  the two have been expected to go to the runoff  mr  hamon s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people  unlike mr  valls  he also clearly distanced himself from some of mr  hollande s more unpopular policies  especially the economic ones  thomas kekenbosch     a student and one of the leaders of the group the youth with beno t hamon  said mr  hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left   we have a perspective we have something to do  to build   mr  kekenbosch said  mr  hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals  such as support for workers  that many   voters believe in  according to mr  kekenbosch  mr  hollande s government  under pressure from the european union to meet budget restraints  struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage french businesses to expand in france  the measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes  but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving france s roughly   percent unemployment rate and its nearly   percent youth joblessness rate  mr  hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income  which would especially help young people looking for work  but would also supplement the livelihood of   french workers  the end goal would be to have everyone receive   euros per month  about       we have someone that trusts us   mr  kekenbosch said   who says   i give you enough to pay for your studies  you can have a scholarship which spares you from working at mcdonald s on provisional contracts for   years    mr  hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones  his leftist pedigree began early  his father worked at an arsenal in brest  a city in the far west of brittany  and his mother worked off and on as a secretary  he was an early member of the movement of young socialists  and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life  he also worked for martine aubry  now the mayor of lille and a former socialist party leader    \n",
              "7  a week before michael t  flynn resigned as national security adviser  a sealed proposal was   to his office  outlining a way for president trump to lift sanctions against russia  mr  flynn is gone  having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the russian ambassador  but the proposal  a peace plan for ukraine and russia  remains  along with those pushing it  michael d  cohen  the president s personal lawyer  who delivered the document felix h  sater  a business associate who helped mr  trump scout deals in russia and a ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by mr  trump s former campaign manager paul manafort  at a time when mr  trump s ties to russia  and the people connected to him  are under heightened scrutiny      with investigations by american intelligence agencies  the f  b  i  and congress      some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes  mr  trump has confounded democrats and republicans alike with his repeated praise for the russian president  vladimir v  putin  and his desire to forge an   alliance  while there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts  a proposal that seems to tip toward russian interests may set off alarms  the amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling    conflict that has cost      lives   who doesn t want to help bring about peace   mr  cohen asked  but the proposal contains more than just a peace plan  andrii v  artemenko  the ukrainian lawmaker  who sees himself as a   leader of a future ukraine  claims to have evidence       names of companies  wire transfers       showing corruption by the ukrainian president  petro o  poroshenko  that could help oust him  and mr  artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to mr  putin   a lot of people will call me a russian agent  a u  s  agent  a c  i  a  agent   mr  artemenko said   but how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk   mr  cohen and mr  sater said they had not spoken to mr  trump about the proposal  and have no experience in foreign policy  mr  cohen is one of several trump associates under scrutiny in an f  b  i  counterintelligence examination of links with russia  according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections  the two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts  mr  sater     a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the mafia  mr  artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in kiev in the early   on embezzlement charges  later dropped  which he said had been politically motivated  while it is unclear if the white house will take the proposal seriously  the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated ukrainian officials  ukraine s ambassador to the united states  valeriy chaly  said mr  artemenko  is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of ukraine to any foreign government  including the u  s  administration    at a security conference in munich on friday  mr  poroshenko warned the west against  appeasement  of russia  and some american experts say offering russia any alternative to a    international agreement on ukraine would be a mistake  the trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in ukraine  but given mr  trump s praise for mr  putin  john herbst  a former american ambassador to ukraine  said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with russia at ukraine s expense      potentially with a plan like mr  artemenko s  it was late january when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the loews regency  a luxury hotel on park avenue in manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches  over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors  mr  cohen     lives two blocks up the street  in trump park avenue  a lawyer who joined the trump organization in   as special counsel  he has worked on many deals  including a   tower in the republic of georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a russian fighter  he is considered a loyal lieutenant whom mr  trump trusts to fix difficult problems  the f  b  i  is reviewing an unverified dossier  compiled by a former british intelligence agent and funded by mr  trump s political opponents  that claims mr  cohen met with a russian representative in prague during the presidential campaign to discuss russia s hacking of democratic targets  but the russian official named in the report told the new york times that he had never met mr  cohen  mr  cohen insists that he has never visited prague and that the dossier s assertions are fabrications   mr  manafort is also under investigation by the f  b  i  for his connections to russia and ukraine   mr  cohen has a personal connection to ukraine  he is married to a ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business  mr  artemenko  tall and burly  arrived at the manhattan hotel between visits to washington   his wife  he said  met the first lady  melania trump  years ago during their modeling careers  but he did not try to meet mr  trump   he had attended the inauguration and visited congress  posting on facebook his admiration for mr  trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with american lawmakers  he entered parliament in    the year that the former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych fled to moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with russia and corruption  mr  manafort  who had been instrumental in getting mr  yanukovych elected  helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president  mr  poroshenko  a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward russia and accused mr  putin of wanting to absorb ukraine into a new russian empire  mr  artemenko     emerged from the opposition that mr  manafort nurtured   the two men have never met  mr  artemenko said   before entering politics  mr  artemenko had business ventures in the middle east and real estate deals in the miami area  and had worked as an agent representing top ukrainian athletes  some colleagues in parliament describe him as corrupt  untrustworthy or simply insignificant  but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth  he has fashioned himself in the image of mr  trump  presenting himself as ukraine s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the west  he even traveled to cleveland last summer for the republican national convention  seizing on the chance to meet with members of mr  trump s campaign   it s time for new leaders  new approaches to the governance of the country  new principles and new negotiators in international politics   he wrote on facebook on jan      our time has come   mr  artemenko said he saw in mr  trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in ukraine      and help advance his own political career  essentially  his plan would require the withdrawal of all russian forces from eastern ukraine  ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether crimea  the ukrainian territory seized by russia in    would be leased to russia for a term of   or   years  the ukrainian ambassador  mr  chaly  rejected a lease of that kind   it is a gross violation of the constitution   he said in written answers to questions from the times   such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing russian interests    the reaction suggested why mr  artemenko s project also includes the dissemination of  kompromat   or compromising material  purportedly showing that mr  poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt  only a new government  presumably one less hostile to russia  might take up his plan  mr  sater  a longtime business associate of mr  trump s with connections in russia  was willing to help mr  artemenko s proposal reach the white house  mr  trump has sought to distance himself from mr  sater in recent years  if mr  sater  were sitting in the room right now   mr  trump said in a   deposition   i really wouldn t know what he looked like    but mr  sater worked on real estate development deals with the trump organization on and off for at least a decade  even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light  mr  sater  who was born in the soviet union and grew up in new york  served as an executive at a firm called bayrock group  two floors below the trump organization in trump tower  and was later a senior adviser to mr  trump  he said he had been working on a plan for a trump tower in moscow with a russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of    one that he said had come to a halt because of mr  trump s presidential campaign   mr  cohen said the trump organization had received a letter of intent for a project in moscow from a russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible   mr  artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with mr  sater  helping to advance the proposal  mr  sater said  made sense   i want to stop a war  number one   he said   number two  i absolutely believe that the u  s  and russia need to be allies  not enemies  if i could achieve both in one stroke  it would be a home run    after speaking with mr  sater and mr  artemenko in person  mr  cohen said he would deliver the plan to the white house  mr  cohen said he did not know who in the russian government had offered encouragement on it  as mr  artemenko claims  but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the ukrainian president   fraud is never good  right   mr  cohen said  he said mr  sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope  when mr  cohen met with mr  trump in the oval office in early february  he said  he left the proposal in mr  flynn s office  mr  cohen said he was waiting for a response when mr  flynn was forced from his post  now mr  cohen  mr  sater and mr  artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause  on friday the president wrote on twitter that he had four new candidates for the job    \n",

spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the republican host s positions   this will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus    it also urges them to ask  hostile

              "      <td>why the truth might get you fired october       the tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results  with the latter often overwhelming the former  as in the iraq war  writes lawrence davidson   by lawrence davidson  for those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices  some insight might be drawn from the following analysis  the action here plays out in the united states  but the lessons are probably universal   back in the early spring of    george w  bush initiated the invasion of iraq  one of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country s dictator  saddam hussein  was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction  the real reason went beyond that charge and included a long range plan for  regime change  in the middle east  president george w  bush and vice president dick cheney receive an oval office briefing from cia director george tenet  also present is chief of staff andy card  on right    white house photo   for our purposes  we will concentrate on the belief that iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power  why did president bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily   the short answer is bush wanted  indeed needed  to believe it as a rationale for invading iraq  at first he had tried to connect saddam hussein to the     attacks on the u s  though he never gave up on that stratagem  the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an american people  already fixated on afghanistan  to support a war against baghdad   but the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful  not because there was any hard evidence for the charge  but because supposedly reliable witnesses  in the persons of exiled anti saddam iraqis  many on the u s  government s payroll    kept telling bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true   what we had was a u s  leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous iraq  and informants who  in order to precipitate the overthrow of saddam  were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons  the strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear iraq lowered the threshold for proof   likewise  the repeated assertions by assumed dependable iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide u s  campaign generating both fear and war fever   so the u s  and its allies insisted that the united nations send in weapons inspectors to scour iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program  as well as chemical and biological weapons   that the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the bush administration and soon forced its hand   on march       bush launched the invasion of iraq with the expectation was that  once in occupation of the country  u s  inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes  or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons   they did not  their iraqi informants had systematically lied to them   social and behavioral sciences to the rescue   the various u s  intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair  and today    years later  their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out   specifically  how to tell when they are getting  true  intelligence and when they are being lied to  or  as one intelligence worker has put it  we need   help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen    to that end the cia et al  are in the market for academic assistance  ahmed chalabi  head of the iraqi national congress  a key supplier of iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden wmd   a  partnership  is being forged between the office of the director of national intelligence  odni   which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent u s  intelligence agencies  and the national academies of sciences  engineering and medicine   the result of this collaboration will be a   permanent intelligence community studies board  to coordinate programs in  social and behavioral science research  that  might strengthen national security     despite this effort  it is almost certain that the  social and behavioral sciences  cannot give the spy agencies what they want   a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations  but even if they could  it might well make no difference  because the real problem is not to be found with the liars  it is to be found with the believers   the believers  it is simply not true  as the odni leaders seem to assert  that u s  intelligence agency personnel cannot tell  more often than not  that they are being lied to  this is the case because there are thousands of middle echelon intelligence workers  desk officers  and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth   that is  they know pretty well what is going on in places like afghanistan  iraq  syria  libya  israel  palestine and elsewhere  director of national intelligence james clapper  right  talks with president barack obama in the oval office  with john brennan and other national security aides present   photo credit  office of director of national intelligence   therefore  if someone feeds them  snake oil   they usually know it  however  having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors   those who got their appointments by accepting a pre structured worldview   have different criterion for what is  true  than do the analysts   listen to charles gaukel  of the national intelligence council   yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the   intelligence agencies  referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies  gaukel has declared    we re looking for truth  but we re particularly looking for truth that works    now what might that mean   i can certainly tell you what it means historically  it means that for the power brokers   truth  must match up  fit with  their worldview   their political and ideological precepts  if it does not fit  it does not  work   so the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by  group think   ideological blinkers  and a  we know better  attitude   on the other hand  as long as what you re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe  you can peddle them anything  imaginary iraqi nukes  israel as a western style democracy  saudi arabia as an indispensable ally  libya as a liberated country  bashar al assad as the real roadblock to peace in syria  the strategic defense initiative  sdi  aka star wars  a world that is getting colder and not warmer  american exceptionalism in all its glory   the list is almost endless   what does this sad tale tell us  if you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence  forget about the liars  what you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow mindedness of the believers   the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class   presumptions that underpin their self confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes   it has happened this way so often  and in so many places  that it is the source of shakespeare s determination that  what is past  is prelude   our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will   no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing  yet the middle echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power  hope springs eternal</td>\n",

              "      <td>a week before michael t  flynn resigned as national security adviser  a sealed proposal was   to his office  outlining a way for president trump to lift sanctions against russia  mr  flynn is gone  having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the russian ambassador  but the proposal  a peace plan for ukraine and russia  remains  along with those pushing it  michael d  cohen  the president s personal lawyer  who delivered the document felix h  sater  a business associate who helped mr  trump scout deals in russia and a ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by mr  trump s former campaign manager paul manafort  at a time when mr  trump s ties to russia  and the people connected to him  are under heightened scrutiny      with investigations by american intelligence agencies  the f  b  i  and congress      some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes  mr  trump has confounded democrats and republicans alike with his repeated praise for the russian president  vladimir v  putin  and his desire to forge an   alliance  while there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts  a proposal that seems to tip toward russian interests may set off alarms  the amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling    conflict that has cost      lives   who doesn t want to help bring about peace   mr  cohen asked  but the proposal contains more than just a peace plan  andrii v  artemenko  the ukrainian lawmaker  who sees himself as a   leader of a future ukraine  claims to have evidence       names of companies  wire transfers       showing corruption by the ukrainian president  petro o  poroshenko  that could help oust him  and mr  artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to mr  putin   a lot of people will call me a russian agent  a u  s  agent  a c  i  a  agent   mr  artemenko said   but how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk   mr  cohen and mr  sater said they had not spoken to mr  trump about the proposal  and have no experience in foreign policy  mr  cohen is one of several trump associates under scrutiny in an f  b  i  counterintelligence examination of links with russia  according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections  the two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts  mr  sater     a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the mafia  mr  artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in kiev in the early   on embezzlement charges  later dropped  which he said had been politically motivated  while it is unclear if the white house will take the proposal seriously  the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated ukrainian officials  ukraine s ambassador to the united states  valeriy chaly  said mr  artemenko  is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of ukraine to any foreign government  including the u  s  administration    at a security conference in munich on friday  mr  poroshenko warned the west against  appeasement  of russia  and some american experts say offering russia any alternative to a    international agreement on ukraine would be a mistake  the trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in ukraine  but given mr  trump s praise for mr  putin  john herbst  a former american ambassador to ukraine  said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with russia at ukraine s expense      potentially with a plan like mr  artemenko s  it was late january when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the loews regency  a luxury hotel on park avenue in manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches  over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors  mr  cohen     lives two blocks up the street  in trump park avenue  a lawyer who joined the trump organization in   as special counsel  he has worked on many deals  including a   tower in the republic of georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a russian fighter  he is considered a loyal lieutenant whom mr  trump trusts to fix difficult problems  the f  b  i  is reviewing an unverified dossier  compiled by a former british intelligence agent and funded by mr  trump s political opponents  that claims mr  cohen met with a russian representative in prague during the presidential campaign to discuss russia s hacking of democratic targets  but the russian official named in the report told the new york times that he had never met mr  cohen  mr  cohen insists that he has never visited prague and that the dossier s assertions are fabrications   mr  manafort is also under investigation by the f  b  i  for his connections to russia and ukraine   mr  cohen has a personal connection to ukraine  he is married to a ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business  mr  artemenko  tall and burly  arrived at the manhattan hotel between visits to washington   his wife  he said  met the first lady  melania trump  years ago during their modeling careers  but he did not try to meet mr  trump   he had attended the inauguration and visited congress  posting on facebook his admiration for mr  trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with american lawmakers  he entered parliament in    the year that the former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych fled to moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with russia and corruption  mr  manafort  who had been instrumental in getting mr  yanukovych elected  helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president  mr  poroshenko  a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward russia and accused mr  putin of wanting to absorb ukraine into a new russian empire  mr  artemenko     emerged from the opposition that mr  manafort nurtured   the two men have never met  mr  artemenko said   before entering politics  mr  artemenko had business ventures in the middle east and real estate deals in the miami area  and had worked as an agent representing top ukrainian athletes  some colleagues in parliament describe him as corrupt  untrustworthy or simply insignificant  but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth  he has fashioned himself in the image of mr  trump  presenting himself as ukraine s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the west  he even traveled to cleveland last summer for the republican national convention  seizing on the chance to meet with members of mr  trump s campaign   it s time for new leaders  new approaches to the governance of the country  new principles and new negotiators in international politics   he wrote on facebook on jan      our time has come   mr  artemenko said he saw in mr  trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in ukraine      and help advance his own political career  essentially  his plan would require the withdrawal of all russian forces from eastern ukraine  ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether crimea  the ukrainian territory seized by russia in    would be leased to russia for a term of   or   years  the ukrainian ambassador  mr  chaly  rejected a lease of that kind   it is a gross violation of the constitution   he said in written answers to questions from the times   such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing russian interests    the reaction suggested why mr  artemenko s project also includes the dissemination of  kompromat   or compromising material  purportedly showing that mr  poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt  only a new government  presumably one less hostile to russia  might take up his plan  mr  sater  a longtime business associate of mr  trump s with connections in russia  was willing to help mr  artemenko s proposal reach the white house  mr  trump has sought to distance himself from mr  sater in recent years  if mr  sater  were sitting in the room right now   mr  trump said in a   deposition   i really wouldn t know what he looked like    but mr  sater worked on real estate development deals with the trump organization on and off for at least a decade  even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light  mr  sater  who was born in the soviet union and grew up in new york  served as an executive at a firm called bayrock group  two floors below the trump organization in trump tower  and was later a senior adviser to mr  trump  he said he had been working on a plan for a trump tower in moscow with a russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of    one that he said had come to a halt because of mr  trump s presidential campaign   mr  cohen said the trump organization had received a letter of intent for a project in moscow from a russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible   mr  artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with mr  sater  helping to advance the proposal  mr  sater said  made sense   i want to stop a war  number one   he said   number two  i absolutely believe that the u  s  and russia need to be allies  not enemies  if i could achieve both in one stroke  it would be a home run    after speaking with mr  sater and mr  artemenko in person  mr  cohen said he would deliver the plan to the white house  mr  cohen said he did not know who in the russian government had offered encouragement on it  as mr  artemenko claims  but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the ukrainian president   fraud is never good  right   mr  cohen said  he said mr  sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope  when mr  cohen met with mr  trump in the oval office in early february  he said  he left the proposal in mr  flynn s office  mr  cohen said he was waiting for a response when mr  flynn was forced from his post  now mr  cohen  mr  sater and mr  artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause  on friday the president wrote on twitter that he had four new candidates for the job</td>\n",

how to protest president donald trump s agenda   last week  breitbart news extensively reported that indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire george soros   politico earlier this month profiled indivisible in an article titled   inside the protest movement that has republicans reeling     the news agency not only left out the soros links  but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify indivisible s message are either financed directly by soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire  as breitbart news documented  organizing for action  ofa  is a   community organizing project that sprung from obama s   campaign organization  organizing for america  becoming a nonprofit described by the washington post as  advocate ing  for the president s policies    in a recent facebook post titled   take a deep breath  then take action   ofa called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and february    when lawmakers will be in their home districts  the post included a link to a guide released by indivisible on how to organize against trump   stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like indivisible guide   the ofa post states  paul sperry  writing at the new york post  relates  the manual  published with ofa partner  indivisible   advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms  and  grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together    rather  spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the republican host s positions   this will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus    it also urges them to ask  hostile  questions      while keeping  a firm hold on the mic       and loudly boo the the gop politician if he isn t  giving you real answers     express your concern  to the event s hosts  they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism  racism  and corruption   it says          even the safest  republican  will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition   the document states   because these actions create the impression that they re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents    sperry reported ofa  plans to stage   rallies across   states this year to attack trump and republicans over obamacare s repeal    earlier this month  nbc news reported on ofa s new actions and its partnership with indivisible  ofa has hired   field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend obama s signature healthcare law  to run that campaign  the group hired saumya narechania      the former national field director at enroll america  which worked to sign people up for obamacare      and a deputy campaign manager         ofa says more than      people have applied to its spring community engagement fellowship  a   training program    of whom have not previously been involved with ofa  and the group has teamed up with indivisible  a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement  to offer organizing training that began thursday night with a video conference  a combined      people have registered to participate in those trainings  ofa said  indivisible s dc branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for rep  dana rohrabacher     as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground   protesters claimed they were only delivering valentine s day cards  indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   tax march in washington and at least   other locations on april    unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by soros or have close links to soros financing  as breitbart news documented last week  meanwhile  earlier this month  politico profiled indivisible and reported that  conservatives  are  spreading unfounded rumors  that the group is  being driven by wealthy donors like george soros    politico  however  seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet s own profile   some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by soros  politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify indivisible s message are either financed directly by soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire  citing angel padilla  a   of the group  politico reported  dubbed  indivisible   the group launched as a way for padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing president donald trump s agenda  they drafted a   protest guide for activists  full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of congress in the language of capitol insiders  the manual has since been downloaded over one million times  indivisible says on its website that over      local groups across the nation have  signed up to resist the trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country    the manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement  the group s website states   what s more  you all are putting the guide into action    showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events  and flooding the congressional phone lines  you re resisting    and it s working    politico reported on  unfounded  rumors being spread about soros s involvement with indivisible  emphasis added by this reporter   its handful of senior leaders count about   contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis  they know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like george soros  which they flatly deny  that paragraph was followed by the following quote from   padilla  emphasis again added by this reporter    it doesn t matter who we take money from      we re always going to get blamed as a soros group  even if we don t take money from soros   said padilla  now an analyst with the national immigration law center   that s one of the attacks and that s fine    while  indivisible  has yet to disclose its donors  politico failed to inform readers that the national immigration law center where the news outlet reported padilla serves as an analyst is financed by soros s open society foundations  the center has received numerous open society grants earmarked for general support  also unmentioned by politico is that padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical national council of la raza  soros is a major la raza donor  politico went on to detail how indivisible has been aided by moveon  org and the aclu   the news website failed to tell readers that moveon  org and the aclu are both financed by soros  a relevant tidbit given politico s claim about  unfounded rumors  that indivisibles  success was being driven by soros    the news website reported  in addition  moveon  org and the working families party joined with indivisible for its first nationwide call on jan     nearly      people phoned in that day  according to levin and moveon organizing director victoria kaplan  indivisible estimates that its second national call  on the impact of trump s immigration order with assistance from the aclu and padilla s group  drew      people  politico also missed that  according to its twitter account  another organizer of the conference call with moveon  org was the international refugee assistance project  a project of the urban justice center  another recipient of an open society grant  taryn higashi  executive director of the center s international refugee assistance project  currently serves on the advisory board of the international migration initiative of soros s open society foundations  politico further reported on indivisible s ties to the organizers of last month s   women s march while failing to mention that soros reportedly has ties to more than    partners  of that march  also  this journalist first reported on the march leaders  own close associations with soros  regarding indivisible and the women s march  politico reported  indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets  leaders of the group were in communication with women s march organizers before their main event on jan     and that partnership will become official when the march unveils the third in its series of   direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities  another indivisible leader mentioned in the politico article is jeremy haile  not reported by politico is that is haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the sentencing project   the sentencing project is reportedly financed by soros s open society foundations  which has also hosted the project to promote its cause  aaron klein is breitbart s jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter  he is a new york times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program

suggested thursday that he would be open to the appointment of an outside counsel to review actions taken by the justice department during the obama administration   conservative radio host hugh hewitt asked sessions in an interview if the new attorney general would consider designating an outside counsel  not connected to politics  to take a second look at justice department actions that provoked republican ire in the last eight years  those include the fast and furious gun scandal and the decisions against bringing criminal charges over hillary clinton s email practices or the internal revenue service s treatment of conservative groups   hewitt contended during his radio interview that the department had become  highly politicized  in the obama administration and floated the idea of a special review by an attorney with the authority to bring criminal charges and  just generally to look at how the department of justice operated    sessions was noncommittal but left the door open  saying he would do everything he could to  restore the independence and professionalism of the department of justice     so we would have to consider whether or not some outside special counsel is needed   sessions said   generally  a good review of that internally is the first step before any such decision is made    the exchange reflected the lingering deep partisan anger over the justice department s decision to close without charges the clinton email investigation and a separate probe into how the irs processed requests for   applications  sessions said the outcome of the irs case  in particular  remained  of real concern    the justice department in   found mismanagement at the tax agency but no evidence that it had targeted a political group based on its viewpoints or obstructed justice  democrats have called for an outside counsel to probe possible contacts between russian officials and the trump campaign  sessions recused himself last week from any investigation that touches the campaign  and rod rosenstein  the prosecutor nominated as his deputy  would not commit at his confirmation hearing this week to step aside from any such investigation  during the campaign  president donald trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into clinton  though he expressed ambivalence about that idea after he won the election  it s not clear how serious sessions was about the idea of a special counsel to investigate past justice department decisions  or how such an undertaking might work \",\n          \"rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one president trump signed on friday   protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states    but the president s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the united states  which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since    many experts believe the order s unintended consequences will make the threat worse  while the order requires the department of homeland security to issue a report within   days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence  terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data  for instance  since the terrorist attacks of sept        no one has been killed in the united states in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from syria  iraq  iran  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen  the seven countries targeted in the order s   visa ban  according to charles kurzman  a sociology professor at the university of north carolina  of muslim americans involved in violent extremism of any kind      for instance  charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group      only   percent had family backgrounds in those countries  said mr  kurzman  who just published the latest of his annual studies of muslim americans and terrorism  the larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the united states  and the president s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame  there was a random quality to the list of countries  it excluded saudi arabia and egypt  where the founders of al qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated  also excluded are pakistan and afghanistan  where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the united states  notably  perhaps  the list avoided muslim countries where mr  trump has major business ventures  nor did the list include the european countries where disenfranchised muslim communities have become hotbeds of militancy  leading to major attacks in paris and brussels in the name of the islamic state  because no visas are required for travel by most european citizens to the united states  and because of the volume of tourism and business  restricting travel from europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named  by mr  kurzman s count    people have been killed in the united states by muslim terrorists since the   attacks      out of a total of more than      killings  by gang members  drug dealers  angry spouses  white supremacists  psychopaths  drunks and people of every description  so the order addresses  at most    of the problem of lethal violence in america  if the toll of sept    is included  jihadists still account for just over   percent of killings   my advice to the new administration would be to declare victory   mr  kurzman said  for the average american  he added   your odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal    but terrorists      the root of the word means  to cause to tremble       do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics  their purpose is to terrify  and they use random and spectacular violence to do it  with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw  to the rational calculations of mr  kurzman  one might simply reply with the list of american cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years  boston san bernardino  calif  and orlando  fla       place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds    bodies and frightened people running for cover  in gallup polls  the number of americans  very worried  or  somewhat worried  about such attacks generally hovers between   and   percent  with understandable spikes after new attacks  in the political realm  where emotions and symbols hold sway  mr  trump s order may reassure some americans that they are safer from terrorism  and more generally  from concerns that muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture   while ostensibly addressing terrorism  it also says that the united states should be protected against those with  hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles  or those  who do not support the constitution     the trouble with such reassurance  even if it is effective  is that it comes at a high cost  in the view of many experts on terrorism  that cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad  where the united states relies on allies  including muslim countries  for intelligence and other help against terrorism   in my opinion  this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation   said daniel benjamin  formerly the state department s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at dartmouth   for the life of me  i don t see why we would want to alienate the iraqis when they are the ground force against isis    at home as well  mr  benjamin said  the president s order is likely to prove counterproductive  the jihadist threat in the united states has turned out to be largely homegrown  he said  and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of muslims that fuel  in rare cases  support for the ideology of the islamic state or al qaeda   it sends an unmistakable message to the american muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation   mr  benjamin said  that  he said  will  feed the jihadist narrative  that the united states is at war with islam  potentially encouraging a few more muslims to plot violence  for an action aimed at terrorism  the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field  jonathan schanzer  the vice president for research at the conservative foundation for the defense of democracies  said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures  it might be justified  but he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures  and no specific plans to address such issues during the temporary restrictions on visitors and refugees   the order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise   he said  mr  schanzer said he was frustrated that during the obama administration  there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the united states and elsewhere   we have several bloody  complex and interlocking conflicts in the middle east   he said   it s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts  admittedly  that is not easy    much easier  clearly  is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense  but as the trump administration is finding out  such pronouncements from an american president have many consequences  not all of them intended  anticipated or desired \",\n          \"britain  u s  sending planes  troops to deter russia in the east        reuters  britain said on wednesday it will send fighter jets to romania next year and the united states promised troops  tanks and artillery to poland in nato s biggest military build up on russia s borders since the cold war   germany  canada and other nato allies also pledged forces at a defense ministers meeting in brussels on the same day two russian warships armed with cruise missiles entered the baltic sea between sweden and denmark  underscoring east west tensions   in madrid  the foreign ministry said russia had withdrawn a request to refuel three warships in spain s north african enclave of ceuta after nato allies said they could be used to target civilians in syria   the ships were part of an eight ship carrier battle group   including russia s sole aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov   that is expected to join around   other russian vessels already off the syrian coast  diplomats said   nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said the troop contributions to a new     strong force in the baltics and eastern europe were a measured response to what the alliance believes are some     russian troops stationed on russia s western flank near moscow    this month alone  russia has deployed nuclear capable iskander missiles to kaliningrad and suspended a weapons grade plutonium agreement with the united states   stoltenberg said  also accusing russia of continued support for rebels in ukraine   those ballistic missiles can hit targets across poland and the baltics  although nato officials declined to say if russia had moved nuclear warheads to kaliningrad   nato s aim is to make good on a july promise by nato leaders to deter russia in europe s ex soviet states  after moscow orchestrated the annexation of the crimea peninsula in     nato s plan is to set up four battle groups with a total of some     troops from early next year  backed by a     strong rapid reaction force  and if need be  follow on forces   as part of that  u s  secretary of defense ash carter announced a  battle ready battalion task force  of about   soldiers would be sent to eastern poland  as well as another  separate force equipped with tanks and other heavy equipment to move across eastern europe    it s a major sign of the u s  commitment to strengthening deterrence here   carter said   britain s defence secretary michael fallon said britain would send an   strong battalion to estonia  supported by french and danish troops  starting from may  the united states wants its troops in position by june   london is also sending typhoon fighter aircraft to romania to patrol around the black sea  partly in support of turkey    although we are leaving the european union  we will be doing more to help secure the eastern and southern flanks of nato   fallon said   syrian shadow  others nato allies joined the four battle groups led by the united states  germany  britain and canada to go to poland  lithuania  estonia and latvia  canada said it was sending   troops to latvia  joined by   military personnel from italy   germany said it was sending between   and   troops to lithuania  with additional forces from the netherlands  norway  belgium  croatia and luxembourg   stoltenberg said allies  commitments would be  a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond   diplomats said it would also send a message to republican presidential nominee donald trump  who has complained that european allies do not pay their way in the alliance   for the kremlin  the u s  led alliance s plans are already too much given russia s grievances at nato s expansion eastwards  although stoltenberg denied going too far   but nato s troop announcements in the baltic states and poland were partly overshadowed by the dispute about whether spain should refuel the russian warships  which was later resolved by moscow s decision to withdraw its request   nato s tensions with russia have been building since crimea and the west s decision to impose retaliatory sanctions   but the breakdown of a u s russia brokered ceasefire in syria on oct     followed by u s  accusations that russia has used cyber attacks to disrupt the presidential election  have signaled a worsening of ties   even before the break down of the syrian ceasefire  russian president vladimir putin suspended a treaty with washington on cleaning up weapons grade plutonium  signaling he was willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the united states over ukraine and syria    additional reporting by sabine siebold  editing by tom heneghan \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n
